# 📘 Project Overview

Sonar signals bounce off surfaces, and the patterns in the data can be used to identify the type of object detected.
This notebook trains a classification model to distinguish between rocks and mines based on these sonar signal features.

# ⚙️ Features

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model training and evaluation

Accuracy testing with sample inputs

🧠 Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression (primary model)

📂 Dataset

File Path: Rock and Mine Prediction/Sonar and Mine.csv

Description: Each row represents a sonar signal return, with 60 numerical features and a label:

R → Rock

M → Mine

Make sure this CSV file is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the path accordingly.


# 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-and-mine-prediction.git

cd rock-and-mine-prediction

2️⃣ Install dependencies

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

3️⃣ Open the Jupyter notebook

jupyter notebook "Rock and Mine Prediction.ipynb"

4️⃣ Run all cells

This will:

Load Sonar and Mine.csv

Train the model

Display evaluation metrics

Optionally test custom inputs

# 📊 Results

The trained model achieves ~85–90% accuracy on the test data.

It can reliably classify unknown sonar samples as Rock or Mine.

# 🧾 Requirements

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

jupyter
